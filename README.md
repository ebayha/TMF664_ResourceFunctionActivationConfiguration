# TMF664_ResourceFunctionActivationConfiguration
TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) Resource Function Activation and Configuration API

This API introduces Resource Function which is used to represent a Network Service
as well as a Network Function. The Network Service and Network Function class definitions
and associations in TR244 (which, in turn, builds on concepts from the SID addenda
on Logical Resource and Service) are utilized to define the Resource Function.
